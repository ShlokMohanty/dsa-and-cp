suppose m = 6
d=5
[6/2]^5.6^()
F^K : (i1,i2,....,ik), where each index of a bag from whcih the ball is taken out is an odd number 
G(t): number of ways to take out balls from the bag so that all the elements from tuple t are indices 
of bags with odd balls.
ans : sum of G(t) over all possible tuples t.
if the number of distinct elements in a tuple is d , then G(t) for the tuple can be calculated 
as [m/2]^d.m^(n-d)
summation(i=1 to k )(H(i).[m/2]^(i).m(n-i))
if i>n , then H(i)=0
dp(i,j) : number of tuples i elements with j distinct ones :
i=1, j=1, dp(i,j)=n for an element there are n ways to choose it 
i=1, j!=1 , dp(i,j)=0
i>1 and j=1 , dp(i,j) = dp(i-1,j).j + dp(i-1,j-1).(n-j+1)

time complexity: O(k*k)
speeding up : values are from 1 to k 
first appearance of i is only after the value of i-1.
{1,2,..,n}--> separated into the subsets 
calculating the value of the H(i)?
if we consider i as the number of the elements of the tupple 
n ways to choose the first one and n-1 ways to choose the second one 
H(i) = S(K.i).j=0 to i-1(n-j) where S(k,i) is the stirling number of teh second kind for the parameters 
k and i . 
problem solved with time complexity : O(k)
